# Rendering things

This is a repo to store all my current rendering-related experiments.
I don't know where I'll stop, just using my daily comute time to learn new things. 

So far, I have:

- raytracer with noisy soft shadows
- pathtracer, monte-carlo method, GPU & CPU
- raytracer with many-lights to add some kind of indirect lighting
